Desecting GSM and CDMA transport layer SMS TPDU(GSM 03.40, TS 23.040 &amp; 3GPP2 C.S0015-A)

GSM 03.40 fully supported
TS 23.040 partially supported
3GPP2 C.S0015-A partially supported

Just some very advance features(eg. compressing, bitmaps and etc) not supported, should quite enough for common development.

BTW: There's a script providing output color rendering support, check another repo for script support.
